              SRMIST’s engineering programs endeavor to be at the forefront of
              innovation. They also foster multi-disciplinary collaborations
              aimed at solving the most pressing global problems. Our mission is
              to seek solutions to global challenges by using the power of
              engineering principles, techniques and systems.

            <p>
              We believe that engineers should not only possess deep technical
              excellence, but also nurture creativity, cultural awareness and
              entrepreneurial skills that come from exposure to science,
              business, medicine and other disciplines – all integral part of
              the SRM experience.
